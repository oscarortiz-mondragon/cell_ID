      <h2 id="Neutrophils">Neutrophils</h2>
      <p>They are the
      body's primary defense against bacterial infection and physiologic stress. Normally, most of the neutrophils circulating
      in the bloodstream are in a mature form, with the nucleus of the cell being divided or segmented. Because of the
      segmented appearance of the nucleus, neutrophils are sometimes referred to as "segs." Less mature neutrophils - those that have recently been
      released from the bone marrow into the bloodstream - are known as "bands" or "stabs". Stab is a German term for rod.</p>

      <h2 id="Lymphocytes">Lymphocytes</h2>
      <p >The round, uniform nucleus and small amount of cytoplasm surrounding it are the best identifying characteristics for
      this cell. Lymphocytes are involved in the specific immune response including antigen-antibody reactions, and are the second most adundant cells in our body

      <h2 id="Basophils">Basophils</h2>
      <p>Basophils are intermediate in size between neutrophils and eosinophils and have simple or bilobed nuclei. They contain
      many coarse purple granules that can vary in size or shape.</p>

    <div>
      <h2 id="Eosinophils" >Eosinophils</h2>
      <p>These cells are 12 - 17 Âµm in diameter - larger than neutrophils, and about 3 times the size of a red blood cell. You
      can see that eosinophils only have two lobes to their nucleus. These cells have large acidophilic specific granules -
      these stain bright red, or reddish-purple.</p>

    <div>
      <h2 id="Monocytes" >Monocytes</h2>
      <p>Monocytes are spherical in shape or may appear amoeboid. They are large in size and have a large nucleus
      that is usually bean shaped. This characteristic differentiates monocytes from neutrophils, which have several lobes
      with a divided nucleus. In tissues, monocytes transform to macrophages. </p>
